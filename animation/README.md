1. Traffic lights

In the exercise, we defined a traffic light animation. Real traffic lights have an amber light in the middle.

Animate a correct sequence of traffic light signalling:

a long green phase
a short amber phase
a long red phase
a short red and amber phase1
back to green

2. Blooming trees

In the class, we defined a tree, but it looks a bit dire. The code was

```javascript

```



Make the tree bloom! Create an animation that looks like the dire tree 8 initially, and then grows blossoms at the end of each twig within 10 seconds. After 10 seconds, the tree should be in full bloom and the animation should stop.

A bloom could be a yellow circle growing in size, or something more intricate with petals and better colors and whatnot.

In your code, modify tree to be abstact in the actual shape of the blossoms. This way, the tree function itself is independent of time. Do not pass the time paramter to the tree function!
